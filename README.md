# Cookie Stand

I built a website with two pages to represent a business that sells salmon cookies in different locations around the world.
The main page gives the customer all necessary information for stores: location address, business hours, contact info.
The sales pages generates a table that displays random amount of cookies per hour, per each location. with a form to add in different numbers

### Reflections and Comments
Overall, I think this went pretty well.
It took me a while to catch up, but I can already tell the difference from how I was reading and understanding Javascript, and my CSS skills have improved extremely.

####What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?
I would love to learn how to put an image as a background and then add a white block behind the text so that you can read the text while it's placed in front of the background. Because I was forced to be more organized with CSS, it forced me to be more organized with javascript, which I think is why I was able to fix many of my problems. I've also realized how much of an ally inspect when designing your whole website, it's amazing.

####How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
It took  me HOURS. I didn't have confidence in finishing my website, so the many hours following the videos again were really worth.
This is also a good place to reflect on the tools and resources used and learned


## This website should meet all guideline from lab 6-10:
Stores the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties
Uses a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour. Objects/Math/random
Calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location using average cookies purchased and the random number of customers generated
Store the results for each location in a separate array… perhaps as a property of the object representing that location
Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser
Calculating the sum of these hourly totals; your output for each location should look like this:


Create a new branch for today’s lab. Make sure it has all of your changes from lab 06 so that you can extend the functionality.

Replace all of your object literals for the salmon cookie stand with a single constructor function that, when called with the ‘new’ keyword, it creates a new instance.

Replace the lists of your data for each store and build a single table of data instead. It should look similar to the following:

Display each stores data in a table format similar to what is below. Break each column by the hour and complete each row with a “Daily Location Total”.


Each cookie stand location should have a separate render() method that creates and appends its row to the table
The header row and footer row are each created in their own stand-alone function
Uses a header cell for both the header row ( containing store hours ), and the footer row ( hourly and grand totals across all stores ).

7 images displayed on the home page of the site
A custom Google font for highlights
A specified standard sans-serif web font for data (such as Arial, Verdana, or Helvetica)
A specified standard serif web font for text (such as Georgia, Times, etc.)
Specified different font colors for all three font usages
A background color for the default page background (make sure font colors have good contrast and are readable on this background)
A different background color for elements such boxes and tables (so make sure the font colors contrast against this well, too!)
Anything else you’d like to add related to style. But remember: simplicity, clarity, and consistency are good things in design.
Be thoughtful about layout and overall organization of the page.
Include all of the typical stuff that you’ll find on the home page of a business: locations, hours, phone number, email address, some text about how awesome the business is, etc. Be creative, and again, think about what is meaningful to a typical end user.
